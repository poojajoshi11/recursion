# recursion

A program that calculates how many ways exist to go up the stairs with 'n' steps and assuming that the person can only go up one or two steps at a time.

I found this question here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o-kdjv7FD0&t=131s
I instantly realized that it sounds a lot like fibonacci sequences except with one's and two's.
